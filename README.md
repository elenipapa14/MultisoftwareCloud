# MultisoftwareCloud

The specific repository is created as part of a team project. The objective is to design an architecture of a cloud infrastructure that will accomplish the distinct requirements of a software company that is aiming to transition their on-premises infrastructure to a cloud environment. 

## Repository Contents
This repository includes the following components:

- **Architecture Diagram**: The proposed architecture.
- **Bicep Code**: Templates that define some parts of the final cloud infrastructure.
- **Billing**: Estimated cost of the cloud infrastructure.
- **JSON Files**: Configuration files that customize the deployed services to meet specific requirements.
- **Screenshots**: Visual documentation capturing the creation and setup of cloud services.
- **Presentation**: A [PowerPoint presentation]('presentation/CloudArchitecturePresentation.pptx') summarizing the cloud architecture, deployment steps, and key considerations.
